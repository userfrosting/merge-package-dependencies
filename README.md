A simple tool that can merge the `dependency` and `devDependency` dependency types for npm/yarn `package.json`s or bower `bower.json`s into a single `package.json` or `bower.json` object (and optionally file). To properly support frontend scenarios, this tool also merges `resolutions`, and ignores unnecessary field recommendations for private npm/yarn packages. Perfect for projects like UserFrosting where plugins (*Sprinkles*) provide virtually all functionality.

> NOTE: While non-semver values are supported, they will act as an override and emit a warning (even if logging is disabled). This override behavior only applies to 'incoming' values. This behavior does not match npm, yarn or bower.
>
> NOTE: This is currently an offline tool, and as such conflicts further down the dependency chain are not evaluated. There is however a duplicate dependency detection tool for yarn to allow the creation of work arounds in the meantime (see [`docs/API.md`](docs/API.md))
>
> NOTE: Any dependencies with a path specified as the version will not be adjusted, even if an output location is specified.

Would be nice to have all error messages look like https://www.npmjs.com/package/better-ajv-errors

Installation
------------

```bash
npm install @userfrosting/merge-package-dependencies --save-dev
```

```bash
yarn add @userfrosting/merge-package-dependencies --dev
```

Example
-------

To merge multiple `package.json`'s into a single object, and save to a specified location...

```js
let mergePackages = require("@userfrosting/merge-package-dependencies");

let template = {
    name: "pkg",
    version: "1.7.2"
};
let pkgPaths = [
    "../app/sprinkles/core/",
    "../app/sprinkles/account/",
    "../app/sprinkles/admin/"
];

let result = mergePackages.yarn(template, pkgPaths, "../app/assets/");
```

Contributing
------------

Contributions are always welcomed, but:

- Try to match the existing coding style.
- New features and fixes must be covered by unit tests (if appropriate).

Its more work, but it greatly helps with flushing out bugs and keeping everything maintainable.
